### Ubiquti UniFi

Awhile ago our group set up the Ubiquti UniFi WiFi router and got it to successfully connect to another device. It was relatively easy to set up by following its start up guide but we did originally have some trouble setting up the cables in the correct manner. I understood what needed to be done by looking at the network diagram inside the quick start guide and found the problem we were having was that the modem needed to be connected to a switch and power supply through a special adapter. The final configuration involved connecting the Ubiquti router to a switch and power then taking a connection from that switch to the modem. We also needed a computer connected to the switch to be able to congifure the router. The router also accepted an internet connection but we couldn't seem to get that shared across the network but that was probably due to NMIT's network.
