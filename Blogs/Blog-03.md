192.240.0.0/16
* Want large subnets at least 1000 hosts each
* 10 bits used for 1024
* CIDR: __22__
* Number of hosts: __1022__
* Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.111111/00.00000000 __255.255.252.0__
* First Net Address: __192.240.0.0__
* First usable host: __192.240.0.1__
* First subnet last usable host: __192.240.3.254__
* Broadcast address: __192.240.3.255__
