### Google Workspace

I have created a Google Workspace account that uses the domain Daniel set up at t4t.freedomain.co.nz and I have set up a couple email accounts for our team. To get this set up I needed to add DNS records to the domain but by following Google's guide I got it set up relatively quickly. The reason I went with Google Workspace over Office 365 was due to it seeming to be a less expensive option.
